## 👀 Research Interests

I am deeply interested in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, with a particular focus on:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
- Unified / Multimodal Models
- Reasoning and Planning
- ML Systems for efficient training and inference

I am especially excited about building **unified models** that integrate perception, reasoning, and decision-making across multiple modalities.
