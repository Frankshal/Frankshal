- 👋 Hello there! My name is Yifei Shao. I got my undergraduate degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence and machine Learning, which I find to be incredibly fascinating and full of potential.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D vision and robotics, because robots are so cool!
- 💞️ I have had the opportunity to engage in research related to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which has been a rewarding experience. Also, I've contributed to the development of two open-source libraries for GNNs, which are available for others in the field to use and build upon. They are GammaGL and OpenHgnn.
- 📫 If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to send an email to yis088@ucsd.edu. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborating on projects, or simply exchanging thoughts on the latest trends in our field.
